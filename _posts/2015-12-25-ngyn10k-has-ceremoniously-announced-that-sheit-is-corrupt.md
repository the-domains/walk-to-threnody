'I see one I hate I see a sorrowful oneÃ‰' 'Don't be an idiot - anything opaque, dark like a decayed tooth?' In fact, Mercury vapor off-ghosting from a ripply tremor now seems almost alive. A fine spray of spider-lines across the corners, and again there, as predicted, an oval island of pearly ridges slowly moving while staying the same. So, right there should be... and it is. We're a Standing Wave. Oh, it's the Remembering Place - I better scram! Walking in place. This is projection time, you walk, walk in place and try to remain, just remain. You're shown many false moments within the true. Basically, I gotta say - it's a big waste of time - and it seems to take forever. I can't tell you how many times I got trapped in there. It's embarrassing. It's a test. - as any Dawn Scout would know - the Midway, we call it when we're drinking. Put your face back on and walk - you worm. There is only you - and the Path. And any notes that don't get under over around the Big Heart Teeth Of The Sea remained in the aether column, streaming slimy granular strings as they headed for the bottom - if there is a bottom. The floor, the floor must be covered in unimaginable wreckage. Don't look down. Leave that at the door Your Most Revered Uselessness.
